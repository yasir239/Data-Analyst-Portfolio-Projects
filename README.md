# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hello — I'm a Data Analyst focused on turning raw data into clear, actionable insights. I work with structured and unstructured datasets to perform exploratory analysis, build visualizations, and deliver data-backed recommendations.

## Projects

- **Bank Blinkit Project**: Placeholder — bank/grocery transaction analysis, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Apple Sales Project**: Placeholder — sales data ETL, reporting, and dashboarding with SQL and Python.
- **Bank Loans Analysis**: Placeholder — loan default analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- **First Portfolio Project**: Placeholder — introductory end-to-end data analysis demonstrating core skills.
- **Walmart Sales Project**: Placeholder — sales forecasting, seasonality analysis, and insights for retail.

## Skills

- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, Power BI)
- Data Cleaning & ETL
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Analysis & A/B Testing
- Machine Learning (regression, classification, model evaluation)
- Git & GitHub

## Notes

- Large dataset files are intentionally excluded from this repository; sample data or links can be added per-project if needed.
- Each project folder contains notebooks and scripts demonstrating the analysis, visualizations, and (where applicable) modeling steps.
